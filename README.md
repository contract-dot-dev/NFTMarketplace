# NFTMarketplace

This repo contains a Foundry project with a `NFTMarketplace` token contract.
It’s designed as a demo repo for use with [contract.dev](https://contract.dev).

Connect it to a Stagenet to automatically import the contract and generate a dedicated Contract Workspace with built-in analytics and tooling.

## Get Started
